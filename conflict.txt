Step 1: Make sure you’re in your project folder
cd "C:/Users/Asus/OneDrive - Bharatividyapeeth/Desktop/BI"


Check you’re inside the repo:

git status


If it says something like “On branch main” or “On branch master”, you’re good.
If not, initialize it:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

🌿 Step 2: Create a new branch named feature
git branch feature


Check all branches:

git branch


You should see:

  feature
* main


The * indicates your current branch.

🔀 Step 3: Switch to the feature branch
git checkout feature


Now you’re working inside the feature branch.

✏️ Step 4: Make some changes

For example, edit your demo.txt file:

echo "This is a new feature being added!" >> demo.txt


Then stage and commit:

git add demo.txt
git commit -m "Added new feature line in demo.txt"

🔁 Step 5: Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main


Now, let’s make a different change in the same file (to simulate a possible merge conflict):

echo "This is the main branch update!" >> demo.txt


Then:

git add demo.txt
git commit -m "Updated demo.txt in main branch"

🧩 Step 6: Merge the feature branch into main
git merge feature

Possible outcomes:

✅ If no conflicts → Git merges automatically.

⚠️ If there’s a merge conflict, Git will show something like:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in demo.txt

⚔️ Step 7: Resolving Merge Conflicts (if any)

Open demo.txt and look for lines like this:

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the main branch update!
=======
This is a new feature being added!
>>>>>>> feature


Manually edit it to keep what you want, for example:

This is the main branch update!
This is a new feature being added!


Then stage and commit the resolved file:

git add demo.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between main and feature"

✅ Step 8: Verify the merge
git log --oneline --graph --all


You should see a merged history of both branches.
