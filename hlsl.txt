🧩 Step 1: Create a Sample Text File
-> echo "This is the original file content." > original.txt


✅ Verify it:

->cat original.txt


You should see:

0/p This is the original file content.

🧱 Step 2: Create a Hard Link
->ln original.txt hardlink.txt


✅ Check both files:

->ls -li


You’ll see something like:

o/p 12345 -rw-r--r-- 2 user user 33 Nov 12 20:20 hardlink.txt
o/p 12345 -rw-r--r-- 2 user user 33 Nov 12 20:20 original.txt


Notice both files share the same inode number (12345) — that means they point to the same physical data.

🔗 Step 3: Create a Soft (Symbolic) Link
-> ln -s original.txt softlink.txt


✅ Check again:

-> ls -li


You’ll now see:

12345 -rw-r--r-- 2 user user 33 Nov 12 20:20 original.txt
12345 -rw-r--r-- 2 user user 33 Nov 12 20:20 hardlink.txt
12346 lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 12 Nov 12 20:20 softlink.txt -> original.txt


The soft link (symbolic link) points to the filename (original.txt), not the data.

📝 Step 4: Edit the Original File
-> echo "New line added to original file." >> original.txt


✅ View all files:

->cat original.txt
->cat hardlink.txt
->cat softlink.txt


Output:

This is the original file content.
New line added to original file.


All three files show the same content because both the hard and soft link point to the same data (directly or indirectly).

🧨 Step 5: Delete the Original File (to see the difference)
rm original.txt


✅ Now check:

cat hardlink.txt
cat softlink.txt


Output:

cat hardlink.txt
This is the original file content.
New line added to original file.

cat softlink.txt
cat: softlink.txt: No such file or directory


The hard link still works (because it points to the actual data on disk),
but the soft link is broken (since its target filename original.txt no longer exists).
